# Tufts Comp 15 - Data Structures

The following data structures were covered in this class:
	
	- Dynamic Array

	- Linked List
	
	- Doubly Linked list
	
	- Sets
	
	- Queues
	
	- Stacks
	
	- Hash Tables
	
	- Trees
	
		* Binary Search Trees
	
		* AVL Balanced Trees
	
	- Graphs
	
		* Dijkstra's Algorithm

Time was also spent learning algorithmic complexity, and searching/
sorting algorithms.

This class also taught broader topics such as abstraction, 
modularity, recursion, and more object-oriented programming.
